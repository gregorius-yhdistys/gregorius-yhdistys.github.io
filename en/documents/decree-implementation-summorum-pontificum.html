The Motu proprio comes into force on September 14. In the document, he expresses his concern for the proper veneration of God in the liturgy of the Church. He also wishes to respond to the devotional requests on the subject and to respect the wishes of those who have affection for the older form of the liturgy of the Mass. At the same time, he hopes that this liturgical initiative will promote reconciliation with the Society of Pius X.</p> <p>There are some faithful in our diocese who long for the old liturgy. With this Motu proprio, they will also have the opportunity in our diocese to celebrate the old form of the Roman Rite. The expectations of these faithful will be met in accordance with the provisions of the Motu proprio, the liturgical rules and the practical possibilities of our diocese.</p> <p>In this context, I would like to point out that there are two communities today which are well known and which officially celebrate the traditional Mass, the so-called Tridentine Mass, in accordance with the Missal of Pope Pius V. One is the Priestly Fraternity of Saint Pius X (Fraternitas Sacerdotalis Sancti Pii X, shortened “FSSPX”), which is also popularly known in the media as “Lefebvrists”, after the name of its founder. It was founded after Vatican II by the French Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, who did not recognise the Council’s decisions and liturgical reform and considered them to be modernist heresy. The Society is headquartered in Ecône, Switzerland. This Society is not in full communion with the Holy Father. Despite the great efforts of Pope John Paul II, the Society, under the leadership of Archbishop Lefebvre, has separated from the Catholic Church. It is therefore a schismatic community.</p> <p>The Priestly Fraternity of Saint Peter (Fraternitas Sacerdotalis Sancti Petri, shortened “FSSP”), founded by former members of the Society of Pius X who wished to remain in full communion with the Holy Father, must be clearly distinguished from the Society of Pius X. They also received permission from Pope John Paul II to celebrate the liturgy according to the old rite.</p> <p>Pope Benedict XVI’s Motu proprio is on the use of the Roman liturgy in the form of the 1962 Missal. It was commonly used before the reform of the Mass liturgy, which was implemented throughout the Church after the Second Vatican Council in 1970.</p> <p>The reformed Roman liturgy, and in particular the rite of the Holy Mass, was not an expression of modernism in the Church. In accordance with the decisions of the Second Vatican Council, it was introduced with the consent of Pope Paul VI, in order to enable the faithful to participate fully and actively in the liturgy and to experience personally the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. The purpose of using vernacular languages is firstly to enable the faithful to fully understand the liturgy and also to unite themselves personally with Jesus Christ and to unite the burden of their lives to him who sacrifices himself. In this way they can more fruitfully participate in the Eucharist.</p> <p>The reintroduction of an earlier Mass does not imply an annulment of the reform or a return to the past. Thus the celebration of Mass according to the 1970 Missal will always remain in the life of the Church – as the Holy Father emphasises – as a normal Roman rite. The old liturgy, on the other hand, is only a special parallel form of the same rite.</p> <p>In order to ensure that the Motu proprio is applied in the same way throughout the diocese and to avoid misunderstandings in parishes due to private interpretations of the document, I confirm the following points:</p> <ol> <li> <p>As the Holy Father often does, I also fervently ask all the faithful who long for an earlier form of celebration of the Mass to give priority to the unity of the parish and diocesan community and to the indispensable witness of faith before the parish.</p> </li> <li> <p>I ask for mutual respect from all the faithful. Different liturgical preferences must under no circumstances cause a lack of tolerance and respect in the personal relationships of parishioners. Such attitudes are not in keeping with Christian love of neighbour.</p> </li> <li> <p>Since the Reformed Roman liturgy remains the main form of liturgy, all public Masses in our diocese will continue to be celebrated only according to the 1970 Missal.</p> </li> <li> <p>In all parish churches and public and semi-public (including non-Catholic) chapels where Mass is normally celebrated for the faithful (even if it is not celebrated every Sunday), the old form of the Mass may not be used at the same time as the Reformed Roman Mass has been celebrated until now. In other words, the Reformed Roman Mass must not be replaced by the old liturgy. This applies to Sundays, feast days and public holidays.</p> </li> <li> <p>In requesting an old form of the Mass, it should also not be forgotten that the priests of our small diocese have little opportunity to respond positively to the requests of each group. Therefore, no priest should be pressured to celebrate the old form of the Mass frequently and regularly.</p> </li> <li> <p>Each priest working in our diocese should always, according to his own possibilities, celebrate Mass in the older form for those groups of the faithful who request it. He is obliged to take into account the papal Motu proprio, all the liturgical rules and this decree.</p> </li> <li> <p>Each priest may always celebrate Mass privately according to the old liturgy if he so wishes. He is obliged to take into account all the liturgical prescriptions in force.</p> </li> <li> <p>a. In the private chapels of religious congregations, the old form of the Mass may be used only with the permission of the superior.</p> <p>b. A priest may also privately use the old form of the Mass in the private chapel of the religious congregations only with the permission of the superior.</p> <p>c. When laypersons participate in the liturgy in the public and semi-public chapels of the religious orders (e.g. the Stella Maris guest house and large chapel, the Carmelite Sisters’ chapel in Espoo, the Missionary Sisters’ Chapel in Helsinki and the Studium Catholicum), the same rules must be followed as in parish churches and public chapels.</p> </li> <li> <p>a. A group of faithful can always invite a priest from abroad to celebrate Mass in the old form. According to canonical regulations, this priest must belong to the Roman Catholic Church and be without canonical barriers. If such a priest were to come regularly to our diocese, he would need the permission of the bishop (as would any other priest who regularly fulfils a pastoral role in our diocese).</p> <p>b. A priest belonging to the Society of Pius X may not celebrate Mass for our faithful because he is not in full communion with the Holy Father.</p> </li> <li> <p>Contacts with the Society of Pius X must comply with the regulations on inter-communion. Only in exceptional circumstances may you attend a Mass celebrated by a priest belonging to the Society of Pius X. Even then, you may not participate in communion because this community is not in full communion with the Catholic Church.</p> </li> <li> <p>a. Religious education should explain to children what the old form of the Mass is and why it is celebrated exceptionally. The main focus of public catechesis and public religious education (e.g. at summer camps) remains the reformed Roman liturgy, which is celebrated mainly in Finnish.</p> <p>b. Since the Eucharist is always a celebration of unity and the communion of the Church, the first communion may only be celebrated in the newer form of the Roman rite.</p> <p>c. It should not be forgotten that many children and young people have no idea what the old form of the Mass is. The parents have the right, at their discretion, to introduce their children to the old form of the rite. However, they should not forget that this can easily alienate children from the church community. When they become adults, they may feel completely alienated from the Church and leave her. Therefore, I would like to ask all parents to attend the main parish Mass with their children - as they have done so far - on a regular basis.</p> </li> <li> <p>The altars of churches and chapels may not be moved or changed without the bishop’s permission. This also applies to altars in public and semi-public chapels of religious communities, where the laity normally attend Mass.</p> </li> </ol> <p style="text-align: center;">Helsinki, August 6, 2007<br /><strong>+ Józef Wróbel SCJ</strong><br />Bishop of Helsinki</p> </div> </div> <footer class="text-center text-xs py-2 bg-brand text-white fixed w-full bottom-0"> <div> <span class='copyright-symbol'>©</span> 2025 Societas Sancti Gregorii Magni </div> </footer> <script type="text/javascript"> document.addEventListener('scroll', function () { if (window.scrollY > 0) { document .querySelector('nav') .classList.add('shadow-lg', '!text-brand', 'bg-white'); } else { document .querySelector('nav') .classList.remove('shadow-lg', '!text-brand', 'bg-white'); } }); </script> </body> </html>
